This directory should include all our scripts related to the paper experiments: 
running experiments, parsing, and plotting scripts.
Several scripts should contribute to running the experiments.
Parsing scripts should be combined in myparser.py.
Plotting scripts should be combined in myplotter.py.
Another main.py file should import both latter components and ties the whole thing up.
